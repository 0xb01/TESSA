## What is TESSA?
TESSA is a Xojo app programmed by Daniel Burkhalter, Tri-B-Werk, that can be used by users to automate the execution of scientific software applications. It can be used to run a variety of different applications, including those that are used for data analysis, numerical simulation, and visualization. TESSA can also be used to manage and track the results of scientific experiments.

TESSA works by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to easily create and manage workflows. A workflow is a series of steps that need to be taken in order to complete a task. TESSA can be used to create workflows for a variety of different tasks, such as data analysis, numerical simulation, and visualization.

Once a workflow has been created, TESSA can be used to execute it. TESSA will automatically start each step in the workflow and will monitor the progress of each step. If a step fails, TESSA will automatically stop the workflow and notify the user.

TESSA can also be used to manage and track the results of scientific experiments. TESSA can store the results of experiments in a database, which can then be used to analyze the results and to generate reports.

### Here are some of the benefits of using TESSA:
-   Save time: TESSA can automate the execution of scientific software applications, which can save users a significant amount of time.
-   Improve efficiency: TESSA can help users to improve the efficiency of their work by automating repetitive tasks and by providing a central repository for data and results.
-   Improve reproducibility: TESSA can help to improve the reproducibility of scientific results by tracking the steps that are taken in a workflow and by storing the results of experiments in a database.
-   Free and open-source: TESSA is a free and open-source software application, which means that it can be used by anyone, regardless of their budget or technical expertise.

If you are a user who is looking for a way to save time, improve the efficiency of your work, and improve the reproducibility of your results, then you should consider using TESSA.

### Here are some of the features of TESSA:

-   Support for a wide variety of scientific software applications
-   Easy-to-use graphical user interface
-   Ability to create and manage workflows
-   Ability to track the results of scientific experiments
-   Free and open-source

TESSA is a powerful tool that can help users to save time, improve the efficiency of their work, and improve the reproducibility of their results. If you are a user who is looking for a way to improve your workflow, then you should consider using TESSA.

**Additional information:** TESSA is a powerful tool, but it is still in its Alpha stage. which means that it is still under development and may not be fully accurate or reliable. The results of TESSA should always be checked by a human before being used.
