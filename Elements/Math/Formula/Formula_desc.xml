	<MainDesc>This element performs allows to solve equations of the form y=x+a. </MainDesc>
	<DerivedType></DerivedType>
	<Mode>Mode defines how arrays are being treated:
Off = no arrays, just the actual value is being calculated
ActiveValue-1 : all values of an array from the first one to one before the active value are being calculated
ActiveValue :  all values of an array from the first one to the active value are being calculated
AllValues: all values of an array from the first one to the last one are being calculated</Mode>
	<Formula>in this field the user has to enter the formula in the form: y=f(x)
The following operators are implemented:
Basics
+,-,^*,/, ^, sqr
Trigonometry:
sin, cos, tan, log, ln
Boolean:

Bit operations:</Formula>
	<Y>predefined attribute y holding the result(s) of the calculation. Letter cases are not evaluated thus y=Y</Y>
	<X>Predefined attribute X for the calculation, any number of attributes with different names can be added in the formula. Letter cases are not evaluated thus x=X.</X>
</Formula>
