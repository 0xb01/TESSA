	<MainDesc>Frame Block will automatically generate a script dependent on the given attributes Mode, Register and Data. The script can also be directly edited in the FrameText Attribute. When any of the upper attributes is changed by the user a new script is automatically being made and the old one override.</MainDesc>
	<Comment>Comment that will be added in front of the script.</Comment>
	<Mode>2 digit hex number that defines the mode of the script (usually 01). If the attributes starts with an „h“, that value is interpreted as hex, (missing 0 will be added to a 2 digit value), if not the value is interpreted as decimal value and will be converted into a hex value with 2 digits. </Mode>
	<Register>6 digit hex value that defines the register of the Dionysos write command. If the attributes starts with an „h“, that value is interpreted as hex, (missing 0 will be added to a 6 digit value), if not the value is interpreted as decimal value and will be converted into a hex value with 6 digits. </Register>
	<Data>4 digit hex value that defines the data being written. If the attributes starts with an „h“, that value is interpreted as hex, (missing 0 will be added to a 4 digit value), if not the value is interpreted as decimal value and will be converted into a hex value with 4 digits. </Data>
	<FrameText>Final script test that is produced from above attributes. This test can be edited and will be saved with the element. As long as none of the main attributes is changed (Mode, Register, Date) it will preserve its value.</FrameText>
